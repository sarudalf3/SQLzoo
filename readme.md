# SQL ZOO

![SQL zoo](images/zoo.jpg "zoo")


The wesbite [sqlzoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net/) contains a lot of exercises about SQL Querys. 
I save my answers for those exercises, trying to keep in mind the syntaxis and tricks in SQL.

**This are optional exercises in full-Stack Python Bootcamp offered by coding dojo**
##### *keep trying, knowledge is awesome*  :facepunch:
